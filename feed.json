I managed to submit Saturday to my will by force. After writing my post in the morning I went outside and took a hammer to the mess left by the fence builders. It wasn&rsquo;t <em>too</em> bad but not up to my standards. Then I did some yard work and mowed and edged the lawn. I spent nearly three hours outside and it was just what I needed.</p>\n<p>After that I crashed in the living room and spent the rest of the day lounging around watching various shows via streaming. Sunday I continued yard work and arrived at a somewhat massive todo list on what I&rsquo;d like to get done before the weather turns 100% winter. That gives me many good months to accomplish it all. Today I have the landscape company coming to give me an estimate and then I&rsquo;m getting started on the list.</p>\n<p>I also managed to get a little weblog work in over the weekend, starting and mostly finishing a new heading pattern that incorporates the page title and an image masthead. I&rsquo;m not entirely satisfied with it and likely won&rsquo;t be until I finish incorporating a fluid type refactor, but I&rsquo;ve added it to the Styleguide and will continue making improvements.

				"content_text": "It's only been two days and I've done so much I don't remember where I left off...oh, right, I was trying to turn a day around. Well, I think I did. I managed to submit Saturday to my will by force. After writing my post in the morning I went outside and took a hammer to the mess left by the fence builders. It wasn't *too* bad but not up to my standards. Then I did some yard work and mowed and edged the lawn. I spent nearly three hours outside and it was just what I needed.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAfter that I crashed in the living room and spent the rest of the day lounging around watching various shows via streaming. Sunday I continued yard work and arrived at a somewhat massive todo list on what I'd like to get done before the weather turns 100% winter. That gives me many good months to accomplish it all. Today I have the landscape company coming to give me an estimate and then I'm getting started on the list.\r\n\r\nI also managed to get a little weblog work in over the weekend, starting and mostly finishing a new heading pattern that incorporates the page title and an image masthead. I'm not entirely satisfied with it and likely won't be until I finish incorporating a fluid type refactor, but I've added it to the Styleguide and will continue making improvements.

				"content_html": "<p>Feeling more like myself this morning and I tracked my day yesterday, which has felt unattainable for the last couple weeks. It wasn&rsquo;t an exhaustive day but it did seem to have lots of moving parts. We had two lovely overcast mornings in a row. Sunday eventually cleared up and got sunny, but Monday stayed overcast and rained off and on all day. Despite a mess that caused elsewhere, it was lovely and made me yearn for fall.</p>\n<p>I finished cleaning the house, vacuuming and dusting my bedroom, the office, and cleaning the bathroom shower. Even with just me in this house, it feels like vacuuming is never done and I just end up on a circular rotation with the vacuum starting in rooms on one side, ending on the other, and starting back over on the other side just a few days later. I got a new toilet bowl brush/holder (exciting!) to replace one that I thought had interchangeable/replaceable heads, which I have some of the heads for, but ended up not actually being the right heads. It was time to retire it anyway.</p>\n<p>I ordered a giant Penzey&rsquo;s spices order last week and am so excited it has shipped. I looked up the last time I did an order and it was in January, so that&rsquo;s about the right timing, every six months I need All The Things in my spice cabinet again. I have also been in contact with a landscaping company I&rsquo;ve worked with before. They do my annual irrigation startup/testing/shut-down and installed my basalt stone path in the side yard. I now need them to give me an estimate for a small retaining wall, they&rsquo;ll be out next week to discuss options, and that brings me to the mess&hellip;</p>\n<p>With the rain yesterday, of course that was the day that they folks working on the fence were along my side replacing posts, and they were not diligent with their mess at all. My neighbor didn&rsquo;t seem to see fit to clean up behind their shed so all the work had to be done <em>from</em> my side, along my garage and driveway, which was a nice clean quarter-minus strip with partial concrete and is now caked with mud and had dribbled and piled blobs of wet concrete from putting the posts in.</p>\n<p>I was admittedly pissed off and spent a good part of the evening spraying the concrete areas off. I&rsquo;ll have to deal with the quarter-minus later after the mud dries and I can either scrape or rake it off and top up the quarter-minus with more. So now that means a project <em>that is not mine, was caused by my neighbor&rsquo;s tree falling, and instigated by them</em> is costing me more money. This is just the never ending headache, and, yes, the neighbors are <em>still</em> not home so they don&rsquo;t have to deal with any of this.</p>\n<p>The only good thing about the status of the fence is that it means all that should be left is putting the panels on and any finishing top rail if that is included in the design. My neighbor did not share any details with me and it doesn&rsquo;t appear they are including any mitigation of their elevated soil along my driveway so that is what the purpose of the retaining wall will be, again, costing me money that I should not have to cover. At this point, knowing that they may be selling the house and moving, I am just holding my breath and hoping that is the case. I&rsquo;m done with them and their no-care attitude about how their property affects their neighbors.</p>\n<p>I also got an email yesterday that my interview will be coming out this Friday. So now I&rsquo;ll be scrambling in the next few days to wrap up my homepage and global navigation changes. I&rsquo;d like to have that done before that gets released. It will be good timing in case new people end up on my blog, as the reorganization should be better for aiding people to get around and learn more about me if that&rsquo;s their goal.</p>\n<p>Last night I finished watching a limited series on Netflix called &ldquo;One Day&rdquo; that is based on a book of the same name. I hadn&rsquo;t read the book and started watching the series over the weekend with only the preview to go by. Had I known what actually was going to occur I may have not started it at this time. I&rsquo;m still sort of recovering from my extended flare and I wasn&rsquo;t planning on spending a few hours ugly crying because of a TV show. I think movies and TV should have to provide warnings for death and sadness just like they do violence/language/sex/nudity.</p>\n<p>I put up a new <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/blogroll-spin-8\">blogroll spin</a> on weblog, and I love the postroll that comprises this one. As I was going through and giving details for each one, I found myself writing more than I normally do. I think each post in this spin is excellent and feels well rounded for the group. I really like when that happens, it makes the spin feel more meaningful and like the post about the spin itself is worth the time I put into it. I also added some missing roadmap/changelog edits to weblog having to do with <code>robots.txt</code> which I am now in the process of editing again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>42</strong>/100</p>",

Despite a mess that caused elsewhere, it was lovely and made me yearn for fall.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI finished cleaning the house, vacuuming and dusting my bedroom, the office, and cleaning the bathroom shower. Even with just me in this house, it feels like vacuuming is never done and I just end up on a circular rotation with the vacuum starting in rooms on one side, ending on the other, and starting back over on the other side just a few days later. I got a new toilet bowl brush/holder (exciting!) to replace one that I thought had interchangeable/replaceable heads, which I have some of the heads for, but ended up not actually being the right heads. It was time to retire it anyway.\r\n\r\nI ordered a giant Penzey's spices order last week and am so excited it has shipped. I looked up the last time I did an order and it was in January, so that's about the right timing, every six months I need All The Things in my spice cabinet again. I have also been in contact with a landscaping company I've worked with before. They do my annual irrigation startup/testing/shut-down and installed my basalt stone path in the side yard. I now need them to give me an estimate for a small retaining wall, they'll be out next week to discuss options, and that brings me to the mess...\r\n\r\nWith the rain yesterday, of course that was the day that they folks working on the fence were along my side replacing posts, and they were not diligent with their mess at all. My neighbor didn't seem to see fit to clean up behind their shed so all the work had to be done *from* my side, along my garage and driveway, which was a nice clean quarter-minus strip with partial concrete and is now caked with mud and had dribbled and piled blobs of wet concrete from putting the posts in.\r\n\r\nI was admittedly pissed off and spent a good part of the evening spraying the concrete areas off. I'll have to deal with the quarter-minus later after the mud dries and I can either scrape or rake it off and top up the quarter-minus with more. So now that means a project *that is not mine, was caused by my neighbor's tree falling, and instigated by them* is costing me more money. This is just the never ending headache, and, yes, the neighbors are *still* not home so they don't have to deal with any of this.\r\n\r\nThe only good thing about the status of the fence is that it means all that should be left is putting the panels on and any finishing top rail if that is included in the design. My neighbor did not share any details with me and it doesn't appear they are including any mitigation of their elevated soil along my driveway so that is what the purpose of the retaining wall will be, again, costing me money that I should not have to cover. At this point, knowing that they may be selling the house and moving, I am just holding my breath and hoping that is the case. I'm done with them and their no-care attitude about how their property affects their neighbors.\r\n\r\nI also got an email yesterday that my interview will be coming out this Friday. So now I'll be scrambling in the next few days to wrap up my homepage and global navigation changes. I'd like to have that done before that gets released. It will be good timing in case new people end up on my blog, as the reorganization should be better for aiding people to get around and learn more about me if that's their goal.\r\n\r\nLast night I finished watching a limited series on Netflix called \"One Day\" that is based on a book of the same name. I hadn't read the book and started watching the series over the weekend with only the preview to go by. Had I known what actually was going to occur I may have not started it at this time. I'm still sort of recovering from my extended flare and I wasn't planning on spending a few hours ugly crying because of a TV show. I think movies and TV should have to provide warnings for death and sadness just like they do violence/language/sex/nudity.\r\n\r\nI put up a new [blogroll spin](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/blogroll-spin-8) on weblog, and I love the postroll that comprises this one. As I was going through and giving details for each one, I found myself writing more than I normally do. I think each post in this spin is excellent and feels well rounded for the group. I really like when that happens, it makes the spin feel more meaningful and like the post about the spin itself is worth the time I put into it. I also added some missing roadmap/changelog edits to weblog having to do with `robots.txt` which I am now in the process of editing again.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**42**/100\n",

It also appears <em>they are still not home</em> so demolition and construction of a fence that divides our property and affects me will be done while the person who hired the job is not around.

Most specifically that there were people who said they were made to feel uncomfortable by me. That makes me so uneasy, and it makes me feel very self-conscious that they don&rsquo;t even feel like they can say it to me when whatever the thing was that happened to make them uncomfortable happened.</p>\n<p>So, I abandoned the vulnerability post and wrote a letter to the community coughing up all these feelings and that I was actually considering leaving because I was now feeling welcome due to all these circumstances. If we could not get past this, not just the event on Sunday, but moreover whatever issues were already bothering people, then I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable to hang around. It was a wrenching post to write, at the time I had literal tears streaming down my face.</p>\n<p>Soon after publishing it I got some responses, as I had asked for in the post. And there was a marked uptick in traffic to the post so I went to lurk on Discord. I found quite the discussion, which at first seemed like the answer to my quandary, that folks didn&rsquo;t seem to want me there and were ready to tell me to &ldquo;get over it&rdquo; in not so many words. I&rsquo;m still not sure entirely what I &ldquo;walked&rdquo; into but as the discussion progressed with me now involved, I feel like there was some progress and I&rsquo;m feeling better about the situation today.</p>\n<p>Communication is hard. It is hard even when people know each other and see each other every day. This world we&rsquo;ve created online with systems that throw a stream of text at us are not what we evolved for. I have always been more comfortable taking time with data and information. Reading it, re-reading it, and re-visiting it later when I&rsquo;m in a different headspace. It&rsquo;s like we don&rsquo;t take the time for that deep thought anymore. We all hate email because it is such a spamfest and we can&rsquo;t even keep up with the legit emails we get, so now we have these terrible in-real-time chats that you either never keep up with or only catch a partial snippet of info from and it hurts my brain. I state my preference by saying &ldquo;I was the person communicating via Jira and not Slack&rdquo; to exemplify my communication style.</p>\n<p>Maybe that is why I like blogging. Blogging is slow, intentional communication.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>32</strong>/100</p>",

If we could not get past this, not just the event on Sunday, but moreover whatever issues were already bothering people, then I wasn't comfortable to hang around. It was a wrenching post to write, at the time I had literal tears streaming down my face.\n\nSoon after publishing it I got some responses, as I had asked for in the post. And there was a marked uptick in traffic to the post so I went to lurk on Discord. I found quite the discussion, which at first seemed like the answer to my quandary, that folks didn't seem to want me there and were ready to tell me to \"get over it\" in not so many words. I'm still not sure entirely what I \"walked\" into but as the discussion progressed with me now involved, I feel like there was some progress and I'm feeling better about the situation today.\n\nCommunication is hard. It is hard even when people know each other and see each other every day. This world we've created online with systems that throw a stream of text at us are not what we evolved for. I have always been more comfortable taking time with data and information. Reading it, re-reading it, and re-visiting it later when I'm in a different headspace. It's like we don't take the time for that deep thought anymore. We all hate email because it is such a spamfest and we can't even keep up with the legit emails we get, so now we have these terrible in-real-time chats that you either never keep up with or only catch a partial snippet of info from and it hurts my brain. I state my preference by saying \"I was the person communicating via Jira and not Slack\" to exemplify my communication style.\n\nMaybe that is why I like blogging. Blogging is slow, intentional communication.\n\n--- \n\n**32**/100\n",

The poor things have been in their 4-inch nursery pots for over a week through a heatwave. The digitalis has pushed four new leaves!\r\n\r\nThe remaining two plants can wait until some day this week. They will go in the back border of sun perennials and I want to do them at the same time I freshen the mulch back there. Sometime in the next week or two the fences between three properties surrounding me will be replaced all at the same time and I need to finish moving my mulch pile before then so it isn't in the way. I also need to work on moving some masonry blocks since one of the fences will need a short retaining wall where my neighbor raised the soil level of part of their back yard without mitigating run off and it drains onto my driveway. Not ideal and it has to get fixed.\r\n\r\nI can't wait for this saga to end. It has been two and a half months since the tree fell on my garage and all this activity is a result of that. We've had trees removed, trees trimmed, roofs fixed, and now fences replaced. My nervous system has never been so frail for so long...well, maybe that isn't true. Last winter/spring there was a string of activity on my block for six months straight that had me so fried I lost nearly 30 pounds and was very unwell. I'm not yet that bad, but if it carries on much longer I could see myself degrading further.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**28**/100\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As it was following July 4th and I felt I had little to say on the matter. If you have nothing positive to say, don&rsquo;t say anything at all? I&rsquo;ve had little positive to say this past week. I have many things broiling in my brain on disparate subjects which all seem to be coalescing right now. How do I—how do <em>we</em>—find ourselves amongst such seemingly different struggles that my brain seems to all see as one?</p>\n<p>Putting all this into coherent words right now is beyond my spoon capacity. I&rsquo;m spending all my spoons on simply surviving day-to-day. I do hope to get the words out soon though. I need to get through this heatwave and that&rsquo;s taking a lot out of me. Climate change is an economic issue. It affects those who are already marginalized the most. I have central air conditioning but I also have a chronic illness that makes me feel the effects of the heatwave regardless. I&rsquo;m lucky I have central air.</p>\n<p>The city of Portland is providing air conditioners to low income folks. This is important but at the same time we are being harangued by utility providers to cut down on our energy usage because they&rsquo;ve done little to upgrade their infrastructure for climate change resilience. For-profit  power companies are beholden to stakeholders' profits above and beyond customer satisfaction and needs. Somehow this dynamic is representative of everything that is wrong right now.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve just passed the hottest day so far, Friday. Today, Saturday, is going to be even hotter. Then Sunday, then Monday, then Tuesday. There&rsquo;s little relief on its way. Already this morning there was a power cut. It was barely 7:30am, I was washing dishes and making coffee and the power went out for about five minutes. We aren&rsquo;t even hot yet. Even if we have the means in our own homes to protect our health, we&rsquo;re still at risk from a money-hungry corporation.

				"content_text": "As it was following July 4th and I felt I had little to say on the matter. If you have nothing positive to say, don't say anything at all? I've had little positive to say this past week. I have many things broiling in my brain on disparate subjects which all seem to be coalescing right now. How do I—how do *we*—find ourselves amongst such seemingly different struggles that my brain seems to all see as one?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPutting all this into coherent words right now is beyond my spoon capacity. I'm spending all my spoons on simply surviving day-to-day. I do hope to get the words out soon though. I need to get through this heatwave and that's taking a lot out of me. Climate change is an economic issue. It affects those who are already marginalized the most. I have central air conditioning but I also have a chronic illness that makes me feel the effects of the heatwave regardless. I'm lucky I have central air.\r\n\r\nThe city of Portland is providing air conditioners to low income folks. This is important but at the same time we are being harangued by utility providers to cut down on our energy usage because they've done little to upgrade their infrastructure for climate change resilience. For-profit  power companies are beholden to stakeholders' profits above and beyond customer satisfaction and needs. Somehow this dynamic is representative of everything that is wrong right now.\r\n\r\nWe've just passed the hottest day so far, Friday. Today, Saturday, is going to be even hotter. Then Sunday, then Monday, then Tuesday. There's little relief on its way. Already this morning there was a power cut. It was barely 7:30am, I was washing dishes and making coffee and the power went out for about five minutes. We aren't even hot yet. Even if we have the means in our own homes to protect our health, we're still at risk from a money-hungry corporation. This system is broken.\r\n\r\nThis thing rolling around in my head goes something like: our struggles today look a little like the past, but the players are different.

I rearranged the markup a little bit and I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I now have truncated posts on the homepage of this blog.</p>\n<p>Next I looked into the default <code>config.json</code> at all the params. I noticed a couple in the list template that seemed to indicate a boolean for enabling pagination on the homepage and category pages. I also looked for the setting that gave a count. I found both. So I created a fresh <code>config.json</code> for my overrides, set <code>pagination_home</code> under <code>params</code> to true and <code>paginate</code> to 10 from 25. Boom! The homepage on this blog now paginates at ten posts and is truncated. Lovely.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>17</strong>/100</p>",

I wasn't sure what the default setting for pagination was, but I would look into it as soon as I got `<!--more-->` truncations working. So, I set about duplicating the necessary templates to override and checked out how some other themes were accomplishing the truncation and put the code in place. I rearranged the markup a little bit and I'm pretty happy that I now have truncated posts on the homepage of this blog.\r\n\r\nNext I looked into the default `config.json` at all the params. I noticed a couple in the list template that seemed to indicate a boolean for enabling pagination on the homepage and category pages. I also looked for the setting that gave a count. I found both. So I created a fresh `config.json` for my overrides, set `pagination_home` under `params` to true and `paginate` to 10 from 25. Boom! The homepage on this blog now paginates at ten posts and is truncated. Lovely.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n**17**/100\n",

I had recently updated Tiny Theme after Matt made some changes following discussion about <code>rel=&quot;author&quot;</code> and <code>humans.txt</code> so I first started looking at the diffs on Github to see if something may have come through there. It didn&rsquo;t appear it did. Then I went through all my Tiny Theme template overrides to check if I was missing a closing tag somewhere. Also couldn&rsquo;t find the cause of the issue.</p>\n<p>So I filed the issue on Micro.blog&rsquo;s help center since what I was finding seems to be related to having &ldquo;Include conversation on post page&rdquo; enabled for your blog. If you disable that, the issue goes away. This functionality includes replies to your post on the &ldquo;single&rdquo; page view of your post by way of <code>conversation.js</code> and there&rsquo;s no way to template that or alter the markup that I can tell. What is happening is that the expected structure of the HTML breaks, in a way, placing the <code>&lt;footer class=&quot;site-footer&quot;&gt;</code> inside of the <code>&lt;div class=&quot;page-content&quot;&gt;</code> when that is enabled. Some folks may not notice this if their blog&rsquo;s styles do not make it apparent, but in the case of Apple Annie&rsquo;s Microblog, the page content has a different background color than the header and footer so it was very apparent that this was happening visually. There is a missing opening or closing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> somewhere.</p>\n<p>I went back to Discord for a couple days and I felt like trash afterwards. This was partially why I had a quiet day yesterday. I really do think I have to limit my time there, it uses up brain cycles and adds just a general overhead I don&rsquo;t need. This is similarly why I don&rsquo;t have notifications enabled on any of my devices. I don&rsquo;t need extra things to check in on. I have enough to do. I might check in a couple times a week, but that might be silly, as the way theses products work make it nearly impossible for intermittent participation to be meaningful. That&rsquo;s why they are such terrible products for knowledge work or documentation or even help. You can say something 10,000 times and the same issue or question will come up again because the information gets lost in the flow, buried by time and more content. It is a poor human tool if you think about it and it makes it more work for those who provide that help or documentation.</p>\n<p>I started watching another series on Netflix that is about a ranch, horses, and a family and young people. As I was getting into it I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the storyline similarities to Heartland. This series takes place in California, whereas Heartland is in Calgary, but they appear to overlap in terms of when the series were started. Heartland, of course, continues to this day, and this series, called Wildfire, ended in 2008. Where Heartland focuses on the daughters and troubled boy, this series focuses on sons and a troubled girl. Very interesting mirroring. There&rsquo;s even a grandfather in the main character lineup. No opinions yet on whether I&rsquo;ll continue with all four seasons, I&rsquo;m only on episode three. But I recall having a hard time getting into Heartland at first too, so I&rsquo;ll give this one a little time. I&rsquo;m really only watching it to pass the time when I&rsquo;m feeling poorly, so I can handle some less than stellar acting or cheesiness.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>12</strong>/100</p>",

This functionality includes replies to your post on the \"single\" page view of your post by way of `conversation.js` and there's no way to template that or alter the markup that I can tell. What is happening is that the expected structure of the HTML breaks, in a way, placing the `<footer class=\"site-footer\">` inside of the `<div class=\"page-content\">` when that is enabled. Some folks may not notice this if their blog's styles do not make it apparent, but in the case of Apple Annie's Microblog, the page content has a different background color than the header and footer so it was very apparent that this was happening visually. There is a missing opening or closing `<div>` somewhere.\n\nI went back to Discord for a couple days and I felt like trash afterwards. This was partially why I had a quiet day yesterday. I really do think I have to limit my time there, it uses up brain cycles and adds just a general overhead I don't need. This is similarly why I don't have notifications enabled on any of my devices. I don't need extra things to check in on. I have enough to do. I might check in a couple times a week, but that might be silly, as the way theses products work make it nearly impossible for intermittent participation to be meaningful. That's why they are such terrible products for knowledge work or documentation or even help. You can say something 10,000 times and the same issue or question will come up again because the information gets lost in the flow, buried by time and more content. It is a poor human tool if you think about it and it makes it more work for those who provide that help or documentation.\n\nI started watching another series on Netflix that is about a ranch, horses, and a family and young people. As I was getting into it I couldn't help but notice the storyline similarities to Heartland. This series takes place in California, whereas Heartland is in Calgary, but they appear to overlap in terms of when the series were started. Heartland, of course, continues to this day, and this series, called Wildfire, ended in 2008. Where Heartland focuses on the daughters and troubled boy, this series focuses on sons and a troubled girl. Very interesting mirroring. There's even a grandfather in the main character lineup. No opinions yet on whether I'll continue with all four seasons, I'm only on episode three. But I recall having a hard time getting into Heartland at first too, so I'll give this one a little time. I'm really only watching it to pass the time when I'm feeling poorly, so I can handle some less than stellar acting or cheesiness.\n\n--- \n\n**12**/100\n",

I also got started on the high dusting and wood floors by starting in my bedroom. The next room is the office and it is far more fussy with all the desk and equipment that need to get cleaned and moved to dust on and around. It is always such a task to clean the office. I think the easiest rooms to clean, and the ones I keep up on the most, are the kitchen and bathroom. Not sure why that is, maybe because they have more floor space and less area rug. The bathroom, of course, only has a small mat in front of the shower and sink, but the kitchen has a carpet tile runner on the &ldquo;work&rdquo; side of the island. That is easy to take apart and move for cleaning.</p>\n<p>Last night I watched the latest episode of Acapulco and I think the duet singers performed my favorite song of the series yet, &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s Watching Me.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve said this before, they may be one of the best parts of this show/series.

I can think of at least two of these off the top of my head, but I'd like to review more and make a list to take action on.\n\nI finally got started on vacuuming and got all the rugs on the main floor cleaned. I also got started on the high dusting and wood floors by starting in my bedroom. The next room is the office and it is far more fussy with all the desk and equipment that need to get cleaned and moved to dust on and around. It is always such a task to clean the office. I think the easiest rooms to clean, and the ones I keep up on the most, are the kitchen and bathroom. Not sure why that is, maybe because they have more floor space and less area rug. The bathroom, of course, only has a small mat in front of the shower and sink, but the kitchen has a carpet tile runner on the \"work\" side of the island. That is easy to take apart and move for cleaning.\n\nLast night I watched the latest episode of Acapulco and I think the duet singers performed my favorite song of the series yet, \"Somebody's Watching Me.\" I've said this before, they may be one of the best parts of this show/series. I'd absolutely buy an album of their covers if Apple ever decides to sell one.\n\n--- \n\n**4**/100\n",

As I had already swapped it, the old one in my hand, I stood still on the chair and pointed at the fresh feeder and the hummingbird landed on it just a few inches from my head. We exchanged looks, me absolutely smitten, while she was probably just glad I wasn&rsquo;t moving.</p>\n<p>I have noticed the females are not very bothered by me and tolerate my presence in the garden pretty well. They will buzz my head sometimes but I think that is due to nestlings or fledglings nearby, as that seems to be the case this year. I am almost positive there is a fledgling hummingbird in the backyard somewhere right now. I hear its ethereal squeaking and this morning while I was out there heard it squeaking with alarm at a crow that landed in the grass. I&rsquo;ve yet to locate its position and I just hope it isn&rsquo;t somewhere that I end up nearly trampling it.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching <em>Pompeii: The New Dig</em> on PBS. This particular dig concentrates on the extraction of what is believed to be a wealthy residence taking up a large portion of a main avenue block. Early on they discover the remains of three humans, two females and a child, but do not much comment on who they think they were. One of the experts on human remains does mention the adult females are undersized for their ages. The cause of death is determined to be from the ceiling of the structure collapsing on them due to the weight of the ash and pumice falling from the sky.</p>\n<p>As they continue to extract more and more from the residence they discover the front of the buildings are in fact two businesses owned by this wealthy family, with the home in the rear. They are a bakery and a fullery, the ancient Roman version of a dry cleaner. Both of these businesses would result in great wealth. They also would mean that many slaves would by working in them. By episode three it is made pretty apparent that working in the bakery was a miserable existence. There was only one door into that part of the structure and it was most likely always kept shut as it opened directly onto the main atrium where the owner&rsquo;s office was located. The bakery was very hot from the giant oven and filled with the dust of grinding flour. It had a single window with bars on it. It&rsquo;s now obvious the human remains found in a room in the bakery were slaves that could not escape because of the locked door and a window with bars.</p>\n<p>I keep thinking about this. For a long time it was thought that Pompeii was only a city of several thousand, but with some of the latest research it is now thought to have been at least 30,000 people. Yet, only 1200 or so human remains have been found. People had to have escaped. They have found very little signs of wagons and horses or donkeys, so they too were taken with the refugees escaping the eruption. I think it is fair to say the human remains that have been found were mostly slaves, forced to stay behind, locked into buildings and unable to escape, or simply too poor, sick, or otherwise unable to get out. Nothing has changed in nearly 2000 years. Humans have become no more ethical or less barbaric in their treatment of each other. I&rsquo;m rather sad.</p>\n<p>I set up my new HomeKit accessory yesterday, a motion sensor for the bathroom lights. I still need to find a good spot on a wall to attach it, for now I&rsquo;m moving it around and trying to see where it has the best range of motion detection. I also need to figure out if I can add a delay to it turning off when no motion is detected, otherwise it will turn off fairly soon after entering if I barely move. That&rsquo;s not ideal.</p>\n<p>Last night I watched <em>Miss Austen Regrets</em>, a sort of biographical historical fiction drama about the last years of Jane Austen&rsquo;s life when we see the struggles that she and her single elder sister and mother feel at them having never married and having to rely on their brothers who both have financial struggles of their own. Both brothers are widows and it seems the lot of a woman&rsquo;s life in that time was: get married and have too many children and die in childbirth OR stay single and live until you die from some disease and in poverty because the life of a single woman is a poor one. Again, times have hardly changed. The poorest people in America are elderly single women with no children and no husband.</p>\n<p>I had a minor crash in the middle of the day yesterday. This time of year is hard, the days are so long and it is too warm and bright for my comfort. I like the early mornings a lot because it is still cool and dim outside and that&rsquo;s my preferable environment. So I took a three hour nap in the middle of the day. When I got up I was only partially revived. The news out of North Carolina regarding a mask ban also left my feeling like crap. It&rsquo;s hard to convey the terror this mask ban instills in me. My life is already so sheltered due to no remaining health precautions for folks who are immunocompromised or otherwise at risk from a Covid infection. My only protection is to remain in my home, which I do for the most part, I don&rsquo;t get out much anymore, or to be able to wear a high quality respirator when I have no choice but to enter society for essentials. I can&rsquo;t even rely on healthcare, dental, or vision needs to be safe for me, and now we have a state passing a bill that will make masks nearly illegal to wear in public or on private property where someone can force you to remove it.</p>\n<p>My tap water was discolored yesterday. For several hours I didn&rsquo;t see anything about it but there was apparently a pressure issue in a nearby neighborhood that caused sediment present in the lines to become mixed up with the flow of water. This <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/water/news/2024/6/11/seeing-discolored-water-southeast-portland-we-are-working-fix-it\">page</a> was kept updated and mentioned that by Wednesday morning all should be clear. As far as I can tell everything is fine today, but I&rsquo;ll need to refill several containers of emergency water that I had to draw from yesterday. Funny not funny the bottom of that linked page posits &ldquo;is the water safe to drink&rdquo; and the water bureau hedges a response and does not give a yes or no.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I am not heading back to Discord any time soon. I&rsquo;ve been off of it for four days and I&rsquo;m not missing the added overhead. It&rsquo;s a similar relief I felt after I stopped using Slack. And after I turned off all notifications on my phone. And on my iPad. And yes on my MBP. Perhaps it is an age thing, or a neurodivergent thing. Or a person-with-an-energy-limiting-illness thing. But I don&rsquo;t need to be told when I should look at or do something. I need to be in control of that and anything that gets in the way of me performing the things I need to perform on the time and schedule I want to needs to get tossed.
