I took a few photos for the post, nothing ground breaking.</p>\n<p>I spent the middle of the day running errands and that wore me out. When I got home it was too warm outside and I was hungry. I tried to remember the last time I drove somewhere prior to yesterday and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was more than a month ago. No wonder it soured my mood. Nobody knows how to drive anymore, or they don&rsquo;t care, or their blood vessels and brain have been so damaged by repeat Covid infections they&rsquo;re now a danger, even more than most people were before Covid. In case you don&rsquo;t keep up with the research like I do, Covid is a vascular disease and many studies have found permanent changes to the brain even with mild infections. Changes that alter distance and spacial perception, definitely not good for driving.</p>\n<p>I made lunch and rested in the afternoon, catching up on some TV shows. By the early evening the drama and emotional upset from Sunday was taking its toll on me. My illness&rsquo;s hallmark symptom, which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, is called Post-exertional malaise (PEM) and can be triggered by any activity, be it physical, mental, or emotional. It often occurs 24+ hours after the triggering event and can lead to crashes.</p>\n<p>I think I staved off the crash but my PEM is usually initially coupled with a &ldquo;wired&rdquo; feeling, termed &ldquo;tired but wired&rdquo; where you are dog-tired and fatigued but you feel anxious + strung out + perhaps a little buzzy (I sometimes get an internal buzz and this often coincides with increased tinnitus). For me it also means my brain won&rsquo;t shut up. This was the number one reason I used to smoke pot. It allowed me to <em>rest</em> when I needed to, it relaxed all my functions and nervous system so that I could actually convalesce. I don&rsquo;t smoke pot anymore, but I may pick it up again some day because it really helps me with my PEM symptoms.</p>\n<p>Since my brain would not shut up I started to go over the Sunday incident again, and the subsequent communication via email, and I started to feel like shit about the entire thing. I used to go through this when I&rsquo;d get sick and have to miss work, I&rsquo;d legitimately loathe myself sometimes for having needs that others would not accept. It&rsquo;s really hard to find therapists sympathetic to this who understand chronic illness and the gaslighting we go through and how that damages us in so many ways. I&rsquo;m positive I have trust issues that crop up in places you wouldn&rsquo;t expect.

I feel like it is the end because I&rsquo;ve left the platform where it occurred, don&rsquo;t have immediate plans to return, and the person in charge has ceased responding to the chain of emails they initiated to work through what happened.

This is a scenario played out across the ages of time and space for women in places made up of and mainly controlled by men. In fact, the only person who had any words of support or encouragement (after the fact) was another woman, who is in a different time zone and came back the following day and read through the thread of comments.

The day is up in the air.\n\nOh, I almost forgot to mention that something I had been banging my head against here on Micro.blog, adding HTML comments into templates, [I finally figured out a workaround for](https://micro.anniegreens.lol/2024/07/14/you-have-got.html). I can't believe this is such an issue! I found several Hugo help forum topics where many responses were hand-waving at the fact that comments were for developers and it doesn't matter if they get retained in the HTML source! *WHAT?I*\n\n--- \n\n**29**/100\n",

Yesterday I determined I would be dead if not for the central air in my house. The hottest two days are today and tomorrow. I just have to make it two more days.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of the last two days in bed. I&rsquo;m in a bad flare. I say that, but really this is just my reality. I could spend nearly 100% of my life in bed if I didn&rsquo;t have tasks necessary to exist in life. All the tasks do is take away my ability to stay in bed and manage my chronic illness.</p>\n<p>This illness makes life nearly impossible to live. It has been underfunded and ignored for so long that it took a pandemic likely causing nearly the same illness for anyone to care to do anything about it. And the only reason they&rsquo;re doing anything is because millions of people becoming chronically ill translates to a lot of money for drugs developed for &ldquo;treatment.&rdquo; There are currently no approved treatments for an illness I&rsquo;ve had for nearly my entire life.</p>\n<p>You can avoid this illness by curbing viral spread. Things like indoor air quality regulations, respirators, mandated (and paid) sick leave, more effective vaccinations, would all contribute to all sorts of viruses spread via the air to be shut down. If you&rsquo;ll recall, the first year of the Covid 19 pandemic all but had no flu season. But that isn&rsquo;t what is happening. There&rsquo;s no money in that. The money is in throwing dollars at pharmaceuticals to make drugs <em>after-the-fact</em>.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t want to take treatments. I want to be accepted for who I am in all my flaws.

				"content_text": "I'm exhausted. Obviously I'm in worse shape than the last heatwave a few years ago, because this one is killing me. Yesterday I determined I would be dead if not for the central air in my house. The hottest two days are today and tomorrow. I just have to make it two more days.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI've spent most of the last two days in bed. I'm in a bad flare. I say that, but really this is just my reality. I could spend nearly 100% of my life in bed if I didn't have tasks necessary to exist in life. All the tasks do is take away my ability to stay in bed and manage my chronic illness.\n\nThis illness makes life nearly impossible to live. It has been underfunded and ignored for so long that it took a pandemic likely causing nearly the same illness for anyone to care to do anything about it. And the only reason they're doing anything is because millions of people becoming chronically ill translates to a lot of money for drugs developed for \"treatment.\" There are currently no approved treatments for an illness I've had for nearly my entire life.\n\nYou can avoid this illness by curbing viral spread. Things like indoor air quality regulations, respirators, mandated (and paid) sick leave, more effective vaccinations, would all contribute to all sorts of viruses spread via the air to be shut down. If you'll recall, the first year of the Covid 19 pandemic all but had no flu season. But that isn't what is happening. There's no money in that. The money is in throwing dollars at pharmaceuticals to make drugs *after-the-fact*.\n\nHonestly, I don't want to take treatments. I want to be accepted for who I am in all my flaws. I want living with a chronic illness and disability to *be allowed*. I want space made for me to live how is necessary with my limitations without the economy and productivity being the only measures of worth. I want people to care about each other and *not want to spread a virus* to other people. There is no economy or freedom in mass disability, I guarantee you.

We walked around the garden and sat on the patio for a few hours chatting. They left around noon and I immediately crashed. I ended up back in my comfy chair later in the afternoon and finished season three of The Bear and my preliminary completion of Definitions on [themes.lol](https://themes.lol). I'll be going back through the list today to refine and then I have four items I have no definition for because I've never used the settings and I have no idea what they do. I'll have to ping Adam about them at some point.\n\n--- \n\n**18**/100\n",

Some folks may not notice this if their blog&rsquo;s styles do not make it apparent, but in the case of Apple Annie&rsquo;s Microblog, the page content has a different background color than the header and footer so it was very apparent that this was happening visually.

I might check in a couple times a week, but that might be silly, as the way theses products work make it nearly impossible for intermittent participation to be meaningful.

Heartland, of course, continues to this day, and this series, called Wildfire, ended in 2008. Where Heartland focuses on the daughters and troubled boy, this series focuses on sons and a troubled girl. Very interesting mirroring. There&rsquo;s even a grandfather in the main character lineup. No opinions yet on whether I&rsquo;ll continue with all four seasons, I&rsquo;m only on episode three.

				"content_html": "<p>So I am now scrambling to remember a day that feels like a blur in my mind.</p>\n<p>I spent the morning yesterday getting some household tasks done and by about 11am I was prepping my driveway for the roofer to come and finally fix my garage roof from the damage my neighbor&rsquo;s tree caused at the end of April when it fell onto my garage. We had unexpected rain and the poor guy was out there during quite a downpour. He still finished the patch job in under an hour and treated that side of the roof that used to be under the tree with a moss remover. Glad to finally have that done.</p>\n<p>I watched a limited series adaptation of <em>North &amp; South</em> on BritBox. I seem to recall trying to start this series in the past and not getting very far, though I can&rsquo;t remember why. This adaption, based on Elizabeth Gaskell&rsquo;s novel <em>North and South</em>, was adapted for television and took some liberties surrounding the time period of the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Wikipedia page notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sandy Welch started adapting Elizabeth Gaskell&rsquo;s 1855 <em>North and South</em> in 2001, making a few changes to emphasise the industrial landscape of the story. Welch&rsquo;s story, for example, begins and ends with the main character Margaret Hale travelling by train, which is not the starting and ending point of the novel (although Gaskell describes the Hales travelling from the South to the North by train). Welch also made the main characters visit the Great Exhibition of 1851. These are changes Welch believed Gaskell would have done &ldquo;if she&rsquo;d had the time&rdquo;, since Gaskell had complained of being under pressure to complete the novel by her editor Charles Dickens.</p>\n<p>— <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_%26_South_(TV_serial)#Origins\"><em>North &amp; South</em> (TV serial)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had no idea Gaskell&rsquo;s editor was DIckens! I read the book in high school and hardly recalled much of it before watching this adaption and jogging my memory. It ended up being well done, with many British actors I recognized and who have had prominent roles in other movies and series I&rsquo;ve watched. I&rsquo;m still a bit mystified by the popularity of Richard Armitage, but he wasn&rsquo;t as offensive in this role as I have found him in other more recent roles.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, I mostly worked on some in-progress blog posts, answering more of the <em>People and Blogs</em> interview questions, which I absolutely need to finish in the next few days, and with organizing and reworking the weblog homepage and global footer navigation items. This is ongoing so I will continue with these tasks today as well.</p>\n<p>It seems most of the continental US is dealing with a heatwave or heatdome in some manner this week. We have started out the week rather cool here in Portland, so cool that I just read that Timberline Lodge at Mt Hood had received seven inches of new snow on Sunday, and another two inches on Monday, and was 34°F. <em>In the middle of June.</em> The summer solstice is in two days and it is still a winter wonderland up on the mountain. Just goes to show you how volatile our wild spaces can be here in Oregon. We are looking at heating up by the end of the week. The high temperature between today, Tuesday, and tomorrow, Wednesday, will jump ten degrees (F).

				"content_text": "So I am now scrambling to remember a day that feels like a blur in my mind.\n\nI spent the morning yesterday getting some household tasks done and by about 11am I was prepping my driveway for the roofer to come and finally fix my garage roof from the damage my neighbor's tree caused at the end of April when it fell onto my garage. We had unexpected rain and the poor guy was out there during quite a downpour. He still finished the patch job in under an hour and treated that side of the roof that used to be under the tree with a moss remover. Glad to finally have that done.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI watched a limited series adaptation of *North & South* on BritBox. I seem to recall trying to start this series in the past and not getting very far, though I can't remember why. This adaption, based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel *North and South*, was adapted for television and took some liberties surrounding the time period of the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Wikipedia page notes:\n\n> Sandy Welch started adapting Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 *North and South* in 2001, making a few changes to emphasise the industrial landscape of the story. Welch's story, for example, begins and ends with the main character Margaret Hale travelling by train, which is not the starting and ending point of the novel (although Gaskell describes the Hales travelling from the South to the North by train). Welch also made the main characters visit the Great Exhibition of 1851. These are changes Welch believed Gaskell would have done \"if she'd had the time\", since Gaskell had complained of being under pressure to complete the novel by her editor Charles Dickens.\n>\n> — [*North & South* (TV serial)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_%26_South_(TV_serial)#Origins)\n\nI had no idea Gaskell's editor was DIckens! I read the book in high school and hardly recalled much of it before watching this adaption and jogging my memory. It ended up being well done, with many British actors I recognized and who have had prominent roles in other movies and series I've watched. I'm still a bit mystified by the popularity of Richard Armitage, but he wasn't as offensive in this role as I have found him in other more recent roles.\n\nBeyond that, I mostly worked on some in-progress blog posts, answering more of the *People and Blogs* interview questions, which I absolutely need to finish in the next few days, and with organizing and reworking the weblog homepage and global footer navigation items. This is ongoing so I will continue with these tasks today as well.\n\nIt seems most of the continental US is dealing with a heatwave or heatdome in some manner this week. We have started out the week rather cool here in Portland, so cool that I just read that Timberline Lodge at Mt Hood had received seven inches of new snow on Sunday, and another two inches on Monday, and was 34°F. *In the middle of June.* The summer solstice is in two days and it is still a winter wonderland up on the mountain.

				"content_html": "<p>That&rsquo;s a &ldquo;think out loud&rdquo; title for today&rsquo;s post. I was just thinking that perhaps titles don&rsquo;t make sense for these as there is no cohesive through-line for the posts other than they represent a day-in-the-posting for this challenge. I sort of like coming up with titles, though. I really like when I&rsquo;m able to make it funny or nod to something from the past. I have one of those coming up on weblog soon.</p>\n<p>Yesterday morning I spent in the garden again, watering, puttering, visiting the birds. I did some yard work and blew off all the hard surfaces. Everyone hates a leaf blower, but unfortunately they are necessary for me, my driveway is nearly the length of my city lot as the garage is positioned at the back corner, and I have street trees so I regularly blow the sidewalk and off the curb to keep the street gutter clear of debris for rainfall. My parking strips are river rock so I also sprayed some weeds. Since one of my neighbors no longer does anything with their yard, weeds in the parking strip have become a problem and I&rsquo;d rather not battle giant weeds so I keep up on them when they are small.</p>\n<p>I had a grocery delivery and now have some mushroom ravioli that I plan on having with an Alfredo sauce. I considered this for dinner last night but ended up making quesadillas, which were quick and apparently just what I needed because they were really good. I have found my Breville convection toaster oven to be perfect for quesadillas. I actually end up using that toaster oven more than my regular oven during the summer as I can avoid the heat the oven produces.</p>\n<p>I caught up on some gardening videos over my morning coffee, which was a French press yesterday. I have gotten into a spice routine with my French press that I don&rsquo;t even need to measure now: turmeric, ground clove, cinnamon, ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cardamom, and ground allspice. It might sound like a lot, but it is less than an 1/8 teaspoon of each and combined it gives my coffee an absolutely new level of deliciousness. Even after washing my press the following day I can still smell the spice mix. It is lovely.</p>\n<p>Yesterday actually flew by. It was nearly 3pm when I looked up from my computer and realized most of the day was already gone and I was only halfway through my todo list. I started the month in a good spot for <a href=\"https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/junited-2024\">Junited</a> with the first two weeks already prepared with posts to share.

				"content_text": "That's a \"think out loud\" title for today's post. I was just thinking that perhaps titles don't make sense for these as there is no cohesive through-line for the posts other than they represent a day-in-the-posting for this challenge. I sort of like coming up with titles, though. I really like when I'm able to make it funny or nod to something from the past. I have one of those coming up on weblog soon.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nYesterday morning I spent in the garden again, watering, puttering, visiting the birds. I did some yard work and blew off all the hard surfaces. Everyone hates a leaf blower, but unfortunately they are necessary for me, my driveway is nearly the length of my city lot as the garage is positioned at the back corner, and I have street trees so I regularly blow the sidewalk and off the curb to keep the street gutter clear of debris for rainfall. My parking strips are river rock so I also sprayed some weeds. Since one of my neighbors no longer does anything with their yard, weeds in the parking strip have become a problem and I'd rather not battle giant weeds so I keep up on them when they are small.\n\nI had a grocery delivery and now have some mushroom ravioli that I plan on having with an Alfredo sauce. I considered this for dinner last night but ended up making quesadillas, which were quick and apparently just what I needed because they were really good. I have found my Breville convection toaster oven to be perfect for quesadillas. I actually end up using that toaster oven more than my regular oven during the summer as I can avoid the heat the oven produces.\n\nI caught up on some gardening videos over my morning coffee, which was a French press yesterday. I have gotten into a spice routine with my French press that I don't even need to measure now: turmeric, ground clove, cinnamon, ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cardamom, and ground allspice. It might sound like a lot, but it is less than an 1/8 teaspoon of each and combined it gives my coffee an absolutely new level of deliciousness. Even after washing my press the following day I can still smell the spice mix. It is lovely.\n\nYesterday actually flew by. It was nearly 3pm when I looked up from my computer and realized most of the day was already gone and I was only halfway through my todo list. I started the month in a good spot for [Junited](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/06/junited-2024) with the first two weeks already prepared with posts to share. I'm now coming up on that threshold and need to get busy curating more. I'm also realizing I'm due for another blogroll spin on weblog, and that has me considering mixing in spins of existing blogs on my blogroll. Why not? Perhaps as new blog posts get published or catch my interest, I'll pull those blogs out of the list again and put them in the spin with the new post of interest.\n\nI worked on a new set of todos for weblog, which I'll get added to my [weblog todo list](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/roadmap) today. One of these todos is to work on some post redirects. That is when I had originally posted something as a blog post on weblog but would like it to act as a slash page or use an otherwise more simple URL without the preceding date of the post. I can think of at least two of these off the top of my head, but I'd like to review more and make a list to take action on.\n\nI finally got started on vacuuming and got all the rugs on the main floor cleaned. I also got started on the high dusting and wood floors by starting in my bedroom. The next room is the office and it is far more fussy with all the desk and equipment that need to get cleaned and moved to dust on and around. It is always such a task to clean the office. I think the easiest rooms to clean, and the ones I keep up on the most, are the kitchen and bathroom. Not sure why that is, maybe because they have more floor space and less area rug. The bathroom, of course, only has a small mat in front of the shower and sink, but the kitchen has a carpet tile runner on the \"work\" side of the island. That is easy to take apart and move for cleaning.\n\nLast night I watched the latest episode of Acapulco and I think the duet singers performed my favorite song of the series yet, \"Somebody's Watching Me.\" I've said this before, they may be one of the best parts of this show/series. I'd absolutely buy an album of their covers if Apple ever decides to sell one.\n\n--- \n\n**4**/100\n",

As I had already swapped it, the old one in my hand, I stood still on the chair and pointed at the fresh feeder and the hummingbird landed on it just a few inches from my head. We exchanged looks, me absolutely smitten, while she was probably just glad I wasn&rsquo;t moving.</p>\n<p>I have noticed the females are not very bothered by me and tolerate my presence in the garden pretty well. They will buzz my head sometimes but I think that is due to nestlings or fledglings nearby, as that seems to be the case this year. I am almost positive there is a fledgling hummingbird in the backyard somewhere right now. I hear its ethereal squeaking and this morning while I was out there heard it squeaking with alarm at a crow that landed in the grass. I&rsquo;ve yet to locate its position and I just hope it isn&rsquo;t somewhere that I end up nearly trampling it.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching <em>Pompeii: The New Dig</em> on PBS. This particular dig concentrates on the extraction of what is believed to be a wealthy residence taking up a large portion of a main avenue block. Early on they discover the remains of three humans, two females and a child, but do not much comment on who they think they were. One of the experts on human remains does mention the adult females are undersized for their ages. The cause of death is determined to be from the ceiling of the structure collapsing on them due to the weight of the ash and pumice falling from the sky.</p>\n<p>As they continue to extract more and more from the residence they discover the front of the buildings are in fact two businesses owned by this wealthy family, with the home in the rear. They are a bakery and a fullery, the ancient Roman version of a dry cleaner. Both of these businesses would result in great wealth. They also would mean that many slaves would by working in them. By episode three it is made pretty apparent that working in the bakery was a miserable existence. There was only one door into that part of the structure and it was most likely always kept shut as it opened directly onto the main atrium where the owner&rsquo;s office was located. The bakery was very hot from the giant oven and filled with the dust of grinding flour. It had a single window with bars on it. It&rsquo;s now obvious the human remains found in a room in the bakery were slaves that could not escape because of the locked door and a window with bars.</p>\n<p>I keep thinking about this. For a long time it was thought that Pompeii was only a city of several thousand, but with some of the latest research it is now thought to have been at least 30,000 people. Yet, only 1200 or so human remains have been found. People had to have escaped. They have found very little signs of wagons and horses or donkeys, so they too were taken with the refugees escaping the eruption. I think it is fair to say the human remains that have been found were mostly slaves, forced to stay behind, locked into buildings and unable to escape, or simply too poor, sick, or otherwise unable to get out. Nothing has changed in nearly 2000 years. Humans have become no more ethical or less barbaric in their treatment of each other. I&rsquo;m rather sad.</p>\n<p>I set up my new HomeKit accessory yesterday, a motion sensor for the bathroom lights. I still need to find a good spot on a wall to attach it, for now I&rsquo;m moving it around and trying to see where it has the best range of motion detection. I also need to figure out if I can add a delay to it turning off when no motion is detected, otherwise it will turn off fairly soon after entering if I barely move. That&rsquo;s not ideal.</p>\n<p>Last night I watched <em>Miss Austen Regrets</em>, a sort of biographical historical fiction drama about the last years of Jane Austen&rsquo;s life when we see the struggles that she and her single elder sister and mother feel at them having never married and having to rely on their brothers who both have financial struggles of their own. Both brothers are widows and it seems the lot of a woman&rsquo;s life in that time was: get married and have too many children and die in childbirth OR stay single and live until you die from some disease and in poverty because the life of a single woman is a poor one. Again, times have hardly changed. The poorest people in America are elderly single women with no children and no husband.</p>\n<p>I had a minor crash in the middle of the day yesterday. This time of year is hard, the days are so long and it is too warm and bright for my comfort. I like the early mornings a lot because it is still cool and dim outside and that&rsquo;s my preferable environment. So I took a three hour nap in the middle of the day. When I got up I was only partially revived. The news out of North Carolina regarding a mask ban also left my feeling like crap. It&rsquo;s hard to convey the terror this mask ban instills in me. My life is already so sheltered due to no remaining health precautions for folks who are immunocompromised or otherwise at risk from a Covid infection. My only protection is to remain in my home, which I do for the most part, I don&rsquo;t get out much anymore, or to be able to wear a high quality respirator when I have no choice but to enter society for essentials. I can&rsquo;t even rely on healthcare, dental, or vision needs to be safe for me, and now we have a state passing a bill that will make masks nearly illegal to wear in public or on private property where someone can force you to remove it.</p>\n<p>My tap water was discolored yesterday. For several hours I didn&rsquo;t see anything about it but there was apparently a pressure issue in a nearby neighborhood that caused sediment present in the lines to become mixed up with the flow of water. This <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/water/news/2024/6/11/seeing-discolored-water-southeast-portland-we-are-working-fix-it\">page</a> was kept updated and mentioned that by Wednesday morning all should be clear. As far as I can tell everything is fine today, but I&rsquo;ll need to refill several containers of emergency water that I had to draw from yesterday. Funny not funny the bottom of that linked page posits &ldquo;is the water safe to drink&rdquo; and the water bureau hedges a response and does not give a yes or no.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I am not heading back to Discord any time soon. I&rsquo;ve been off of it for four days and I&rsquo;m not missing the added overhead. It&rsquo;s a similar relief I felt after I stopped using Slack. And after I turned off all notifications on my phone. And on my iPad. And yes on my MBP. Perhaps it is an age thing, or a neurodivergent thing. Or a person-with-an-energy-limiting-illness thing. But I don&rsquo;t need to be told when I should look at or do something. I need to be in control of that and anything that gets in the way of me performing the things I need to perform on the time and schedule I want to needs to get tossed.

I do not have a guiding topic or principle for this challenge, I&rsquo;m simply trying to complete the <a href=\"https://100daystooffload.com/\">100DaystoOffload</a> challenge in as short a time as possible. Why short? If I can avoid it, I don&rsquo;t want to have to renew this domain after the first year.</p>\n<p>I think the cadence may be every day but it might be every few days and will mostly be observational posts. Between July 1st and December 31st are 184 days, so I&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to get this done. I&rsquo;m going to try to keep tally of daily &ldquo;happenings&rdquo; and then pick and choose from them to curate these posts, so if a day is rather boring perhaps the post will likewise be boring.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m set on not creating a theme for this blog since I don&rsquo;t want to think about that. I don&rsquo;t want to read posts that I&rsquo;m writing to complete this challenge and start thinking about tweaking CSS, which I inevitably always do, it&rsquo;s just a thing with me. I had posited a question to the MB community for contributed theme suggestions but I took the post down because I remembered that I don&rsquo;t get much interaction here, it&rsquo;s sort of not a &ldquo;community&rdquo; to me. Many people find that here, but I just haven&rsquo;t. So I&rsquo;m sticking with the MB default theme at this time. Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a different one I like at some point, but since this blog is all about the posting challenge, I really don&rsquo;t care.</p>\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s Monday, June 10, 2024. I don&rsquo;t have much planned today. It&rsquo;s supposed to be about 80°F here in Portland. I might wash a car, I might vacuum the house, I might not do either thing. I need to finish my interview questions for People &amp; Blogs, which I started working on last weekend and was doing really well until some events occurred across both of my online communities that not only wiped me out mentally but made me quite sad and not in the right headspace for writing interesting things about myself and my blog(s).</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m taking a little breather from some places right now in order to save some brain space. I have not only my interview questions to complete, but next week my garage roof will be worked on and between now and the end of the month I need to sell a car, do some heavy shopping, arrange some other household maintenance appointments, and work on my newest web project, currently code named Tiny Pages. So I need to cut down on the inputs for a little while. I&rsquo;m also really excited to catch up on the CSSDay videos on YouTube, which I&rsquo;m very thankful to have signed up as a supporter last year so I can watch them as soon as I am able to.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s it, that is the inaugural challenge post.

I do not have a guiding topic or principle for this challenge, I'm simply trying to complete the [100DaystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge in as short a time as possible. Why short? If I can avoid it, I don't want to have to renew this domain after the first year.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI think the cadence may be every day but it might be every few days and will mostly be observational posts. Between July 1st and December 31st are 184 days, so I've got plenty of time to get this done. I'm going to try to keep tally of daily \"happenings\" and then pick and choose from them to curate these posts, so if a day is rather boring perhaps the post will likewise be boring.\n\nI'm set on not creating a theme for this blog since I don't want to think about that. I don't want to read posts that I'm writing to complete this challenge and start thinking about tweaking CSS, which I inevitably always do, it's just a thing with me. I had posited a question to the MB community for contributed theme suggestions but I took the post down because I remembered that I don't get much interaction here, it's sort of not a \"community\" to me. Many people find that here, but I just haven't. So I'm sticking with the MB default theme at this time. Maybe I'll find a different one I like at some point, but since this blog is all about the posting challenge, I really don't care.\n\nSo, it's Monday, June 10, 2024. I don't have much planned today. It's supposed to be about 80°F here in Portland. I might wash a car, I might vacuum the house, I might not do either thing. I need to finish my interview questions for People & Blogs, which I started working on last weekend and was doing really well until some events occurred across both of my online communities that not only wiped me out mentally but made me quite sad and not in the right headspace for writing interesting things about myself and my blog(s).\n\nI'm taking a little breather from some places right now in order to save some brain space. I have not only my interview questions to complete, but next week my garage roof will be worked on and between now and the end of the month I need to sell a car, do some heavy shopping, arrange some other household maintenance appointments, and work on my newest web project, currently code named Tiny Pages. So I need to cut down on the inputs for a little while. I'm also really excited to catch up on the CSSDay videos on YouTube, which I'm very thankful to have signed up as a supporter last year so I can watch them as soon as I am able to.\n\nSo that's it, that is the inaugural challenge post. Exciting, right?\n\n--- \n\n**1**/100\n",
